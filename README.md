# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor



This project is a **Student Performance Prediction System** built using **Machine Learning**. Given student attributes like gender, race/ethnicity, parental education level, and test scores, the model predicts their **Math Score** out of 100.

> ✅ Achieved **88% Accuracy** using Linear Regression!

- `Gender`
- `Race/Ethnicity`
- `Parental Level of Education`
- `Lunch Type`
- `Test Preparation Course`
- `Reading Score (out of 100)`
- `Writing Score (out of 100)`

📌 **Target Variable**: `Math Score`
